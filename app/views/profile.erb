  			<p>
        I am a recent marketing graduate from the Sauder School of Business at UBC who wants to help a company grow its brand awareness and community engagement through the use of social media platforms and impeccable customer service. I want t to ensure a company not only increases its number of customers but creates meaningful relationships with them. I can help a company do this in Spanish, English and French (soon in Turkish).  <br/><br/>

        My current volunteer position at ArtStarts in Schools as a Gallery Assistant and previous internship at Purple Dirt as a Social Media and Content Manager have made me cultivate excellent people, communications and marketing skills. I have developed expertise in customer service as well as in a variety of software and platforms.  <br/><br/>

        Volunteer and work experiences are not the only things that have shaped me throughout my life, travelling has been a huge influence too. It has made me a very adaptable, creative and curious person. It proved me that nothing is impossible when my problem-solving skills exceeded my expectations and I was able to travel the outskirts of Myanmar without knowing the local language.  <br/><br/>

        For me, learning isnâ€™t over when you graduate, it is only the beginning. Therefore, I continuously explore my interests and feed my curiosity. I learned basic coding skills (check the website I built http://www.luzalvarado.info ), I obtained various online certifications and I am currently learning Turkish by myself.  <br/><br/>

        Challenges are what motivate me so I am not scared of sudden changes or new environments. I believe in team collaboration, passion in what you do and positivity. Thus, I consider my skills and personality would perfectly fit a startup environment.  <br/><br/>
